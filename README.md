# Project Overview

This project, developed by Timothy Hebert, leverages the power of AI and environmental variables to manipulate and analyze data. It is designed to provide users with insights into various datasets, including CSV files, and integrates with OpenAI and GROQ APIs for enhanced data processing capabilities.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
3. Set up your `.env` file based on the `.env.example` provided, inserting your own OpenAI and GROQ API keys.
4. To start the project, execute the main script by running `streamlit run app.py`.

Remember to add your `.env` file to `.gitignore` to keep your API keys secure.
